## Why SOFORT module?

Our SOFORT module for prestashop allows buyers to make a wire transfer of the respective amount during the order process using their online banking account. You as a merchant will receive a real-time confirmation after the SOFORT transaction has been completed. This enables you to immediately ship goods on stock and digital goods - and the buyer will receive the purchased items faster.
